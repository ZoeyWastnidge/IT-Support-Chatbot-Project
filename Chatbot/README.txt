This project is coded in Python using the Pytorch library in a virtual python environment. To use it, you must
install Anaconda, and set that as your main python when setting it up. You then use the Anaconda terminal and download
pytorch, and create a virtual environment with that installed. 

You then run this in terminal (I used VS Code for this) and run training.py on first time run, followed by chat.py

As it requires a great deal of setup, I will prepare a video
of how the deliverable works and attach it to my final submission.
